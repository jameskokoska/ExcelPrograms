### Usage
Add transactions under `Name` and the cost under `Cost`. Enter users names by replacing `Name 1`, `Name 2`, ... etc. Enter the percentage for each user that they spent for the respective transaction. A summary of total amount spent for each person can be seen on the `Summary` sheet. Each person should pay back the spender this amount.
